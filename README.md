## 📑 Case Studies
- [Applied YY Method: Compressed Public Case Study](YY_CASE_PUBLIC.md)  
- [Applied YY Method: Layperson Walkthrough](YY_CASE_WALKTHROUGH.md)  

These demonstrate how the YY Method was stress-tested on an entirely new domain (cryptographic immutability proofs) and reached auditor-verifiable fluency in hours.
