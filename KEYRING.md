## Key Scope and Rotation Policy

- This GPG key (fingerprint: 63FC60BA7F66F645CFBF9C8482BBD72944B8168E) currently signs commits and releases
  across all of my repositories.
- If projects grow in scope, I may introduce **project-specific release keys**.
- Any new keys will be published in this KEYRING.md, Archive.org, and social
  channels, with revocation certificates for old keys where applicable.
- Auditors should always cross-check fingerprints against at least two
  independent sources (e.g. repo + Archive.org, or repo + X/Bluesky).
